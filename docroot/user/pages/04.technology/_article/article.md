<h1>Completely new technology</h1>
<h3>Unbounded scalability, fast confirmations, no miners, no blocks, low fees.</h3>
</div>
<p>Obyte data is stored and ordered using <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph</a> (DAG) rather than blockchain. This allows all users to secure each other's data by referencing earlier data units created by other users, and also removes scalability limits common for blockchains, such as blocksize issue.</p>
<p>Blockless design is simpler because there are no blocks, there are only transactions. Users just add their transactions to the end of the DAG themselves, they don't have to wait for miners to create a new block and there is no guesswork regarding whether miners will include their transaction in the block.</p>
<p>The consensus algorithm used to protect from double-spends is based on establishing a total order within the DAG. This is achieved by selecting a chain, called main chain, which gravitates towards units issued by commonly recognized reputable users â€” witnesses.</p>
