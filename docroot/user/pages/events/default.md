 ## LaBITconf in Montevideo, Uruguay - December 2019
Santiago Law travelled to Montevideo in December 2019 to represent the PolloPollo project at the Latin American Bitcoin Conference. PolloPollo received a "Dreamers" Award for the work that has been carried out since it was devised at a Hackathon held in the Universidad San Bolivar in Caracas.  Donations are being sent directly from donors to merchants in Venezuela who can pass on goods to people free from intermediaries using the Obyte DAG platform. Goods are registered by merchants who can pass them on to those requesting them when payment has been received in bytes.
