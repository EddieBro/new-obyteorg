Obyte was very proud to be invited again to participate as a key technology provider in the second Annual Hackathon sponsored by the Bosch Connectory in Stuttgart, Germany.  40 developers from Bosch and selected partners joined the event and worked on 7 different challenges, the solutions for 5 of which were powered by Obyte technology.

Teams used the Obyte DLT platform to create a vending machine accepting only BoschCoin cryptotokens, a distributed on-demand market place for renting power tools, a decentralized peer to peer energy trading platform, a crypto powered meeting room booking solution, and an Autonomous Agent for a decentralized marketplace with built-in escrow functionality and a dutch auction mechanism.

Luke Angell gave a introduction to Obyte for those who were not well acquainted with the project, and Tarmo Annus followed up with a detailed description about the differences between Obyte and Ethereum Smart Contracts, as well as quick tutorial about how to get started writing Smart Contracts on Obyte. The presentations concluded with Rui of the Bosch Connectory making a quick demostration of how Bosch had created their own BoschCoin crypto token using Obyte and had integrated BoschCoin payments with certain appliaances in the Connectory like a coffee machine and 3D printer.
