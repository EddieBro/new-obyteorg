# Textcoins
## Send any Obyte asset by email or via chat
### Instead of writing long. cryptic wallet addresses and having to make sure receipients already installed a wallet, Obyte offers a far easier alternative. Textcoins!
You simply type the email address of the recipient instead of the wallet address, and the funds will be sent as a textcoin to the recipient. If the recipient doesn't have a wallet installed already, the email content will provide instructions how to do so. Once installed, the textcoin can be claimed and funds are transferred to the recipient's newly installed wallet. 
### Easy claim back textcoins to avoid loss of funds
Senders can see the outgoing transactions that were sent as textcoins and can see whether or not the recipient claimed the funds. If you get impatient or you perhaps mistyped the recipient's email address, you can claim back the funds by a simple click in the transaction history. No more funds getting lost, no more time consuming exchange and double checking of wallet addresses.
### Send textcoins through chat apps
Instead of sending textcoins through email, you can also send them in any text messaging app of your choice. You simply create the textcoin, copy the text from it and paste it in the chat with the recipient as plain text. Simple and easy. The recipient can click the link and will automatically claim the textcoin or be prompted to install a wallet if he didn't already.
