        <h2>Cold storage</h2>
        <p>Textcoins can be used as cold storage if they are not sent to anybody but instead the 12 secret words are stored safely on offline media.</p>
        
        <h2>Physical coins</h2>
        <p>Textcoins can be recorded using any tamper-evident media such as scratch cards, PIN envelopes, in any shape including coins. They can be passed in physical form from person to person, like cash, without any trace on the ledger. The tamper-evident packaging should make it evident when the 12 secret words have been extracted and the textcoin value claimed.</p>
        
        <h2>Private textcoins</h2>
        <p>Textcoins can also be used to transfer privacy assets such as [Blackbytes](/platform/blackbytes). Along with the 12 secret words, these textcoins have to also carry the private payloads, that's why they are much larger than textcoins holding public assets and they are sent as files with .coin suffix. The files are usually several megabytes large. To claim the funds stored on a private textcoin, one needs to double-click the .coin file, which launches one's Obyte wallet and automatically claims the value stored on the textcoin. <a href="https://medium.com/obyte/private-textcoins-6a2288d80757">Learn more about private textcoins</a>.</p>

## Putting Textcoins to good use
There are several ways textcoins can be used. Firstly, you can use it to send any asset on the Obyte platform to any user you know. Either through email or through chat. But there are also other ways in which Textcoins can be a relevant alternative to regular transactions.

One such case is a scenario where you have to distribute an asset by a significant number of transactions in very short time. In this case, creating a physical Textcoin can be an effective alternative. By preparing a number of Textcoins in advance, and creating QR-codes of them on pieces of paper, you massively increase the number of transactions you can do in a very short amount of time. Examples of such uses could be standing at the entrance of a conference room, handing out the physical representations of the Textcoins to visitors pouring through the doors. In a matter a minutes, you can easily distribute hundreds of Textcoins.

Another example is to distribute an asset to random people to raise awareness of the asset. In this case you won't force people passing by to stop and install a wallet, but will allow them to bring with them the Textcoin and scan the QR code when they have time to install the wallet and claim the Textcoin.
