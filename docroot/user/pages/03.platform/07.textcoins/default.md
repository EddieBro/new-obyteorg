# Textcoins
## Send any Obyte asset by email or via chat
### Tired of writing long. cryptic wallet addresses? Obyte offers an alternative. Textcoins!
Simply type the email address of the recipient instead of a wallet address, and funds will be sent to the recipient. If the recipient doesn't have a wallet installed already, the Textcoin provides instructions how to it. The textcoin can be claimed and funds are transferred to the recipient's new wallet. 

### How Textcoins work
Imagine a safe where you store your money. This safe is locked but it is placed in public view where everyone can see it. This is how distributed ledgers work. Every user's wallet is visible on the ledger but it is locked and requires a key to unlock. Textcoins are actually wallets. So a Textcoin can be compared to a safe, too. The difference between a regular wallet and a Textcoin is, that the private key to the Textcoin-wallet gets passed along with the safe itself. If you leave a locked safe in a public park with the key placed on top of it, the first to see it can open the safe and claim the content. The second to find the safe will find an empty safe. And this is exactly what happens to Textcoins. Under normal circumstances, Textcoins are sent to a specific user through chat or mail. This prevents others from getting the key. But Textcoins can be published in public as well, and in this case, the first to claim the funds will get it while everyone else will be told that the Textcoin has already been claimed. So when you send a Textcoin, make sure to send it to the intended recipient only, or funds could be claimed by another who saw it.

### Send Textcoins through chat apps
Instead of sending Textcoins through email, you can also send them in any text messaging app of your choice. You simply create the Textcoin, copy the text from it and paste it in the chat with the recipient as plain text. Simple and easy. The recipient can click the link and will automatically claim the textcoin or be prompted to install a wallet if he didn't already.

### Claim back Textcoins
In the GUI wallet the history of transactions reveals which outgoing transactions were created as Textcoins. Click the transaction to see whether the recipient claimed the funds or not. In case you want to claim back the textcoin you simply click the "Claim back" link in the transaction. No more funds getting lost, no more time consuming double checking of wallet addresses.

## Putting Textcoins to good use
There are several ways textcoins can be used. Firstly, you can use it to send any asset on the Obyte platform to any user you know. Either through email or through chat. But there are also other ways in which Textcoins can be a relevant alternative to regular transactions.

One such case is a scenario where you have to distribute an asset by a significant number of transactions in very short time. In this case, creating a physical Textcoin can be an effective alternative. By preparing a number of Textcoins in advance, and creating QR-codes of them on pieces of paper, you massively increase the number of transactions you can do in a very short amount of time. Examples of such uses could be standing at the entrance of a conference room, handing out the physical representations of the Textcoins to visitors pouring through the doors. In a matter a minutes, you can easily distribute hundreds of Textcoins. 

Another example is to distribute an asset to random people to raise awareness of the asset. In this case you won't force people passing by to stop and install a wallet, but will allow them to bring with them the Textcoin and scan the QR code when they have time to install the wallet and claim the Textcoin.
