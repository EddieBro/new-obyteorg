# Internet of Things

Thanks to low energy consumption and relatively small memory requirements, Obyte is well suited for IoT applications.

[Several PoCs](/platform/iot/proofs-of-concept) have been developed in conjunction with the Bosch Connectory in Stuttgart.  Obyte has participated as a key technology provider in 2 Connectory Hackathons which have produced a number of interesting applications, several of which are being developed further by different Bosch business untis.

## Payment channels
Iot applications often use [payment channels](/platform/payment-channels) to organize streaming payments between two IoT devices or between a user wallet and a IoT device. They can be used e.g. for charging electric vehicles, parking, renting a room, payment for data streams, payment for services such as real time voice recognition, and other machine-to-machine payments.

## Autonomous things
In an environment where:
* IoT devices are equipped with **wallets**;
* the wallets work in an **open** payment system that is easy to join and the payments are fast, cheap, and reliable;
* the payments between unknown IoT devices that don't trust each other are still **safe** thanks to [payment channels](/platform/payment-channels);

in this environment, IoT devices can have economic relations with each other and with people, they can specialize in a few tasks they are designed to do, sell their services to other devices and to people, and buy the services they need. These capabilities make them **autonomous things** that are integrated in value chains and participate in economic life on (almost) equal terms with people.

## Byteduino
For use in very small devices such as ESP32 and ESP8266, Obyte node was rewritten in C/C++ and ported to Arduino platform. See [Byteduino homepage on github](https://github.com/Papabyte/Byteduino?target=_blank).
